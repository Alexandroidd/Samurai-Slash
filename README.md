3/28:  Basic layout of game today. Got the background image to sit still and cover the entire page - a success. Also began testing with basic shape elements. Started devising random timing mechanism in beginning and setting down a basic expected timeline for the game's progress

3/29: Much more difficult today. Hard refinement of game timeline - which functions fire when.
